                    From the data that we got, it can be seen that women dominate more when it comes to shopping.
                    In the product category it is shown through the data that clothing was chosen as the highest preferred product of the customers.

                <p>
                    Based on Forbes(2013), we can infer that women dominate the shopping industry since “women have primary care-giving responsibilities” making “women find themselves buying on behalf of everyone else in their lives.” 
                    It is understandable why clothing was chosen as the highest in product category as clothing is a necessity for us.
                    It is stated by Fibre2Fashion (2006) that clothes are essential because it is “to protect it against the adverse climate conditions”.
                    Aside from being a necessity, it elevates our beauty and increases our self-confidence.

                    This can be applicable to businesses.
                    Sales associates can use this as a guide to observe the preferences for what customers would purchase or products that are in high demand.
                    With this data, it can be used to predict future product preferences.
                    This can help businesses predict products on demand, manage inventories, and make strategic decisions to efficiently satisfy the demands of their customers.
